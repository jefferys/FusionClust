Description: Collects multiple fusion points into fusion point ranges. Can
    be one or two ended. Clustering is based on a window, with each fusion point
    initially its own group. Groups are merged if they contain fusions that are
    less than or equal to the window distance apart. For two-ended grouping,
    ends are clustered separately and then groups are merged when they contain
    opposite sides of the same fusion.
